# Plasteel7DTD
Simple mod for 7 Days to Die that adds Plasteel building shapes to the game. Built for Alpha 21 b324.

## Installation
- Download the mod by clicking Code -> Download Zip in the top-right corner of the Github page
- Extract the folder Plasteel7DTD-main from the Zip file and place it in %APPDATA%/7DaysToDie/Mods
- You might need to create the Mods subfolder if you haven't added other mods yet

## Highlights
- Twice as much baseline HP as Steel shapes
- Explosive resistance of 2.00 (Steel has 1.75)
- Stability glue of 400 (Steel has 300)
- Prohibitively expensive on time and resources
- XML only so can be server-side

## Gameplay
- No recipes, but forge/crucible and chemstation are needed
- Leadspelter is a prerequisite resource crafted at forge/crucible:
	- 10 Iron
	- 5 Brass
	- 5 Lead
	- 5 Clay
- Working Stiff boxes will drop Leadspelter uncommonly
- Plasteel Primer is the primary resource crafted at chemstation:
	- 1 Oil
	- 10 Scrap Polymer
	- 25 Gunpowder
	- 25 Leadspelter
- Working Stiff boxes will drop Plasteel Primer rarely
- Plasteel blocks can be crafted in the inventory or workbench:
	- 1 Plasteel Primer
	- 10 Forged Steel
- One unit of Plasteel Primer upgrades a Steel block to a Plasteel block
- One unit of Plasteel Primer will fully repair a damaged Plasteel block

## Use Case
Created to go alongside higher difficulty settings and/or mods that make zombies more dangerous to bases. I personally will be using it for stress points on a wasteland base with the Behemoth and Tier 6 zombie mods as well.

## Updates
The localization is only in English so if anyone wants to add other languages just send a PR on Github and I'll update it. If future Alpha builds break this mod I will try to update it when I get a chance.
